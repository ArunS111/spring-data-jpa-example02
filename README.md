spring-data-jpa-example02
=========================

* Gradle build using group version overrides to intentionally fail on conflict resolution

* Annotation processor generation using default Querydsl entities, QuerydslJpa entities and Autovalue.

* Annotation Processing is disabled in the Compile Task and handled explicity for each processor.

* Processing Querydsl Entities from different entity providers can occur in the same Java Compilation task if the output files are unique.

* When using @QueryDelegate or @QueryProjection the querydsl annotation processing _must_ be separated into multiple tasks as the Java Compilation fails (Java Filer Object) when encountering a scenerio where the same Java source class is generated by more than one processor.
