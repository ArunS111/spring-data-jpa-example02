spring-data-jpa-example02
=========================
gradle build using group version overrides with fail on conflict resolution

annotation processor generation using querydsl entities ,querydslJpa entities and autovalue.

Annotation Processing is disabled in the Compile Task and handled explicity for each processor.

Processing Querydsl Entities from different providers can occur in the same Java Compilation task as the output files are unique.

When using @QueryDelegate or @QueryProjection the querydsl annotation processing must be separated into multiple tasks as the Java Compilation fails when encountering a scenerio whertr the same Java source class is generated by more than one processor.
